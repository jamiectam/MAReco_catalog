This is a pilot indicator catalog to document indicator data, metadata, and other related resources for Fisheries management areas in the Maritimes Region. This catalog serves as Section 2 of the Maritimes Ecosystem Report. 0.1 Purpose The Maritimes Ecosystem Indicator Catalog contains information about all the indicators used for Section 1 of the Maritimes Ecosystem Report. This catalog also includes ecosystem indicators that have been developed, but that may not 1) have current and significant impacts to the context or management area of focus, 2) be developed enough for operational use to support decisions in a management area. This is a summary of the best available information describing the ecosystem specific to the management areas within the Maritimes Region. 0.2 How to use this catalog "],["pressures-and-stressors.html", "Pressures and Stressors", " Pressures and Stressors Pressures and stressors are factors that can influence the status of ecosystems. Environmental pressures and stressors impact ecosystems through a variety of climate, phyical, or oceanographic mechanisms. Such mechanisms, generally have no direct management process, but understanding trends of such pressures or stressors can help to plan and prepare for future scenarios.

Main level objectives: Productivity is conserved, protected, maintained, and restored so that components can play their role in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Biodiversity is conserved, maintained, and restored to preserve the structure and natural resilience of aquatic ecosystems. Habitat and habitat features including the chemical, biological, phycisl, ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems are conserved, protected, maintained, and restored.
