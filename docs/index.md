# About {-}

This is the Maritimes Ecosystem Indicator Catalog v.1.0. This is a pilot indicator catalog to document indicator data, metadata, and other related resources for Fisheries management areas in the Maritimes Region.

This catalog serves as Section 2 of the Maritimes Ecosystem Report.


## Purpose

The Maritimes Ecosystem Indicator Catalog contains information about all the indicators used for Ecosystem Summary Reports for the Maritimes Region. This catalog also includes ecosystem indicators that have been developed, but that may not 1) have current and significant impacts to the context or management area of focus, 2) be developed enough for operational use to support decisions in a management area. 

This is a summary of the best available information describing the ecosystem specific to the management areas within the Maritimes Region.
